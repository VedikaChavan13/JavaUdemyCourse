//public java keyword is whats called an access modifier
//An access modifier allows us to define which parts of our code,or even someone elses code,can acess a particular element.
//The class keyword is used to define a class. The class name will be the text following the keyword, so HelloWorld in this case. The left and right curly braces, they are used to define the class code block, or class body.
//A method is a collection of statements, one or more, that perform an operation. We'll be using a special method called the main method,that Java looks for when running a program. It's the entry point for any Java code, and Java looks for this main method to start and run the program.
