The if then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code, only if a particular test evaluates to *true*.
This is know as conditional logic

*Conditional logic* uses specific statements in java to allow us to check a condition, and execute certain code based on whether that condition(the expression) is true or false.

*Assignment Operator* (=) assigns the value of an expression, to the variable to the left of the operator.  
Ex: boolean isAlien = false; (so isAlien is the variable in this case, and its been set to false, which is the valuee of our expression.)

*Equality Operator* (==) tests to see if two operands are considered equal, and returns a boolean value.
Ex: if (isAlien == false) So here isAlien is tested against the value false.

*The code block* allows more than one statement to be executed, in other words, a block of code 
The format is: 
           if (Expression){
            //put one or more statements here
           }

=! not equal to sign 

*Conditional Operators*
&& Conditional AND
|| Conditional OR
?: Ternary ( Shorthand for if-then-else statement)

*The logical AND operator and the logical OR operator*
The and operator comes in two flavours in Java, as does the or operator
&& is the logical and which operates on boolean operands- Checking if a given condition is true or false.
The & is a bitwise operator working at the bit level. This is an advanced concept.(Both conditions should be true)

Likewise || is the logical or, operates on boolean operands
The | is a bitwise operator, which is also working at the bit level.(Atleast one condition should be true)

*Not operator* 
The exclamation mark(!),or NOT operator, is known as the Logical Complement Operator.
It can be used with a boolean variable, to test for the opposite value.


*The TERNARY OPERATOR?:* has three operands. The only operator currently in java that does have three. Officially, Java calls it the conditional operator.
The struture of this operator is: 
operand1? operand2 : operand3
First condition operand1 is always boolean test
The ternary operator is a shortcut to assigning one of two values to a variable.
It is a shortcut of the if-then-else statement.
